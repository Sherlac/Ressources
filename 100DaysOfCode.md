## Day 1 (19/12/2020) : 

  • I've learned to use GitHub by creating new branches on my repository, making commits and pull requests.

• I've begun a online course on OpenClassrooms. This is well structured and there are a lot of practical exercises. 
• My GitHub repository seems to be ok, I commited and pulled my work of the day.
